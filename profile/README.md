# Poa: The Perpetual Organization Architect

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for **Poa**, and open source no-code platform for creating and managing fully community-owned decentralized, self-sustaining organizations. This repository houses the smart contracts and front-end code that power the Poa platform and the underlying Perpetual Organization Protocol.

## Introduction

Poa is designed to empower individuals and organizations to create "Perpetual Organizations" â€” decentralized entities that are unstoppable and fully owned by the community through contribution and democracy based voting instead of buying voting tokens. Whether you're building a worker-owned cooperative, an open-source collective, a community DAO, or a student organization, Poa provides the tools you need to manage governance, roles, tasks, and treasury functions seamlessly.

This GitHub organization contains the core components of Poa:

- **Smart Contracts**: The decentralized logic that powers Poa, encapsulated in the Perpetual Organization Protocol.
- **Front-End**: The user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the protocol without needing to write code both to create a custom Perpetual Organization and interact with one.

## Repositories

### Smart Contracts

- **[Poa Smart Contracts](https://github.com/PerpetualOrganizationArchitect/contracts)**
  - **Description**: This repository contains the smart contracts that form the backbone of the Perpetual Organization Protocol. These contracts manage governance, roles, tasks, and treasury operations, ensuring that your organization runs smoothly on the blockchain.
  - **Technologies**: Solidity, Foundry

### Front-End

- **[Poa Front-End](https://github.com/PerpetualOrganizationArchitect/Poa-site)**
  - **Description**: The front-end codebase for Poa, providing an intuitive interface for creating and managing your decentralized organization. This repo includes the UI/UX components, integrations with the smart contracts, and various utilities to enhance the user experience. Also inlcudes our subgraph which won ETH DENVER 2024 best new subgraph.
  - **Technologies**: React, Next.js, JavaScript, Apollo Client, The Graph, IPFS, hosted with fleek
  - **Live Demo**: [poa.community](https://poa.community)
### Subgraph

- [Poa Subgraph](https://github.com/PerpetualOrganizationArchitect/subgraph)
- **Description**: The subgraph captures critical data from Poa's smart contracts, enabling quick and reliable data retrieval using GraphQL for user and organization dashboards.
- **Technologies**: The Graph, GraphQL, IPFS
- **Accolades**: Winner of ETH Denver 2024 for Best New Subgraph
